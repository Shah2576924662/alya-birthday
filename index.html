      <h2>Dear Alya,</h2>
      <p>
        On your special day, I want you to feel how deeply you are loved. Every sunrise reminds me of your light, every star of your sparkle, and every mile between us of how lucky I am to have you to miss. Thank you for your laughter, your kindness, and the way you make every ordinary moment feel like magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until I can hold you again, let these words wrap around you like the warmest embrace. Close your eyes and imagine me whispering them, and know that I am counting down the moments until we celebrate together in person.
